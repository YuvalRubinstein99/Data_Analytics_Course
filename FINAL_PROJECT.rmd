### Intro
<h1>Background:</h1>
•	The chaser is a well-known TV quiz show broadcast on Kan11.

•	Each team has 4 players.  Their goal is to beat the chaser and win as much money as they can.

•	For the rules of the game, visit: [chaser_wiki](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%A3_(%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%96%D7%99%D7%94))



<h1>The Data:</h1>
* We use the Israeli chaser data from kaggle  ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomaskonstantin/the-chasegame-show-israel-episode-data))

* Each row in the raw data describes a specific episode, there are a total of 100 episodes (within 3 seasons)

* When we use the term **'Fast Round'** - it is the first round for each individual player
* When we use the term **'Final Round'** - it means the last round when all the players are playing together as a team



<h1>Goals:</h1>
* Our main goal is to track after the pattern of players who won the chaser, we'll try to do it by checking how the group's ages and genders affect the winning ratio


* We also want to understand better the players who took risks- who tend to take more risks?



### Importing & Tidying

First, lets import the relevant libraries:

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library (ggplot2)
library (readr)
library(dplyr)
library(matrixStats)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyr)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(car)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library (ggplot2)
library (readr)
library(dplyr)
library(matrixStats)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyr)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(car)
```

Second, we will load our data from the csv file:

```{r}
raw_data <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuvalRubinstein99/Data_Analytics_Course/main/The_Chase__Dataset.csv")
```

Now, lets get to know our data better:

```{r}
glimpse(raw_data)
```

* As you can see, the dataset is built in a horizental structure in which each row represents the entire team (and a specific episode).
* We want to change the data structure to a **vertical structure**, in which each row will represent individual player. 


* In order to do it we'll create 4 tables - one for each player (from each team) and combine it all to a one vertical table: 

```{r}
# Adding a group id number:
raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(group_id = row_number())

# Creating tables for each player:
p1_tb <- raw_data %>%
  select(p_1_gender, p_1_age, p_1_fast_round_sum, p_1_play_sum_chosen, p1_round_status, group_id, team_total_sum, question_answered, game_result, season) %>%
   rename(
    Gender = p_1_gender,
    Age = p_1_age,
    Fast_round_sum = p_1_fast_round_sum,
    Play_sum_chosen = p_1_play_sum_chosen,
    Round_status = p1_round_status,
    Team_question_answered = question_answered
    ) %>%
  mutate(player_num = 1)

p2_tb <- raw_data %>%
  select(p_2_gender, p_2_age, p_2_fast_round_sum, p_2_play_sum_chosen, p_2_round_status, group_id, team_total_sum, question_answered, game_result, season) %>%
     rename(
    Gender = p_2_gender,
    Age = p_2_age,
    Fast_round_sum = p_2_fast_round_sum,
    Play_sum_chosen = p_2_play_sum_chosen,
    Round_status = p_2_round_status,
    Team_question_answered = question_answered
    ) %>%
  mutate(player_num = 2)

p3_tb <- raw_data %>%
  select(p_3_gender, p_3_age, p_3_fast_round_sum, p_3_play_sum_chosen, p_3_round_status, group_id, team_total_sum, question_answered, game_result, season) %>%
     rename(
    Age = p_3_age,
    Gender = p_3_gender,
    Fast_round_sum = p_3_fast_round_sum,
    Play_sum_chosen = p_3_play_sum_chosen,
    Round_status = p_3_round_status,
    Team_question_answered = question_answered
    ) %>%
  mutate(player_num = 3)

p4_tb <- raw_data %>%
  select(p_4_gender, p_4_age, p_4_fast_round_sum, p_4_play_sum_chosen, p_4_round_status, group_id, team_total_sum, question_answered, game_result, season) %>%
     rename(
    Gender = p_4_gender,
    Age = p_4_age,
    Fast_round_sum = p_4_fast_round_sum,
    Play_sum_chosen = p_4_play_sum_chosen,
    Round_status = p_4_round_status,
    Team_question_answered = question_answered
    ) %>%
  mutate(player_num = 4)

## Combine the 4 tables:
combined_data <-rbind(p1_tb, p2_tb, p3_tb, p4_tb)

glimpse(combined_data)

```

* You can see that now we have **404 rows** instead of 101 (because there are 4 players in each team)


* We are going to add few columns:
  + **player_id** - int type, holds a unique value for each player.
  + **risk_taker** - int type, holds 1 if the player took risk and 0 if not.
  + **risk_bonus** - int type, for how much money did the player took the risk? (0 if not, negative if chose the opposite).

```{r}
risk_cols = c("Fast_round_sum", "Play_sum_chosen")

chaser <- combined_data %>%
  mutate(
    player_id = row_number(),
    risk_taker = rowDiffs(as.matrix(combined_data[,risk_cols])) > 0,
    risk_bonus = rowDiffs(as.matrix(combined_data[,risk_cols])))

```


### Data Visualizations

* Lets check out our data variables:

```{r}
summary(chaser)
```

* A few interesting things we can see:
  + The youngest player is 15 years old, and the oldest is 69.
  + The lowest fast round amount was 5k, and the highest was 60k while the mean is about 30k.
  + The number of questions answered have a median of 21, and the highest was 31.


<h3>We are going to check the different distributions of our variables:</h3>

* Lets start with the right answers distribution:

```{r}
questions_dist <- ggplot(chaser, aes(x=Team_question_answered)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fill="tan1") + labs(title="Answers Distribution", xlab="Team's right answers") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

questions_dist
```

* The Age distribution:

```{r}
ggplot(data=chaser, aes(x= Age)) +
  geom_density(fill="tan1") + labs(title="Age Distribution", xlab="Age") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

* Lets check for Age Outliers by Gender:
```{r}
boxplot(chaser$Age~chaser$Gender, main="Age by Gender Boxplot",
        xlab='Gender', ylab='Age', col="tan1")

```


* Lets see the Fast Round total money distribution:

```{r}
ggplot(data=chaser, aes(x= Fast_round_sum)) +
  geom_density(fill="darkolivegreen3") + labs(title="Fast Round Distribution", xlab="Fast Round Sum") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```



* We'll try to understand better if our variables distributions are normal using qq plots, if it is we expect for a clear straight line:

```{r}
plt_fast_round <- ggplot(chaser, aes(sample=Team_question_answered)) +
  geom_qq(color = "honeydew3") + geom_qq_line(col="red") +
    labs(x= "Fast Round Sum")

plt_age <- ggplot(chaser, aes(sample=Age)) +
  geom_qq(color = "honeydew3") + geom_qq_line(col="red") +
    labs(x= "Age")

plt_question <- ggplot(chaser, aes(sample=Team_question_answered)) +
  geom_qq(color = "honeydew3") + geom_qq_line(col="red") +
    labs(x= "Team's Number of Questions Answered")


grid.arrange(plt_fast_round,plt_age,plt_question)
```



Seems like all 3 variables are close to normal distribution, but not exactly are.



* Lets check the connection between the age, the fast round sum and the gender:

```{r}
ages <- c(14, 26, 30, 35, 45 ,70)
chaser_by_age <- chaser %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(Age, ages))

ggplot(data = chaser_by_age, aes(x = age_group, y = Fast_round_sum,
color = Gender)) + geom_boxplot() 
```



Based on the plot we can suppose that:

  + The median of the fast round amount is 30k.
  + The median is pretty much in the same range for each age group and gender (except for the age group of 35-45).
  + Also there are only one outlier, so we don't have to deal with extreme values.


### Statistic Tests

* **We want to perform a T-test on the average age of the players according to their gender and a var test on the standard deviation of the ages.**

* First, Lets takes a look at the age distribution of both male and female players:

```{r}
ggplot(data=chaser, aes(x= Age, color = Gender)) + 
  geom_density() + labs(title="Age Distribution by Gender",
                    y = "Gender", x = "Age") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

male_players_age <- chaser %>%
  filter(Gender == "male") %>%
  select(Age) %>%
  as.matrix()

female_players_age <- chaser %>%
  filter(Gender == "female") %>%
  select(Age) %>%
  as.matrix()

```


* Lets perform a var test on the std of the age according to gender:
  + H0- the proportion between the variances is 1
  + H1 - the proportion between the variances is not 1

```{r}

var.test(male_players_age, female_players_age, alternative = "two.sided")
```

* Note: with a 95% confidence level, the variances are the same, therefore we will assume that the ages of both genders have the same variance for the t.test.

* Lets perform the T-test on the average age according to gender:
  + H0 - Male's average age is equal to the Female's average age
  + H1 - Male's average age is greater than the Female's average age

```{r}

t.test(male_players_age, female_players_age,alternative = "greater", var.equal = TRUE)
```


* We can understand two things from the tests:

  + With a p-value of 0.2392 we can not reject H0 in the var-test and say that in a 95% confidence level - **both the age distribution of men and women have the same variance.**

  + With a p-value of 0.009065 we can reject H0 in the t-test and say that in a 95% confidence level - **the mean of male players age is greater than the mean of the female players age.**



<h5>**Now we are going to check the distributions of players who took risks**</h5>
(while - 1 represents if the player was willing to take the risk and 0 otherwise.)

Lets start with seeing which kind of risk takers we have:

```{r}
risk_plot <- chaser %>%
  filter(risk_bonus != 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Age, y=risk_bonus, color=Gender)) + 
  geom_jitter() + geom_abline(y=0, color="green") + labs(title="Risk Bonus Amount by Age and Gender", subtitle = "(0 represents players who stayed with their initial amount)", y = "Risk Bonus Amount", x = "Age") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
risk_plot
```

* We can see a few interesting things regard the players who chose to **take a smaller amount** in order to be one step ahead of the chaser:
  + There were only 10 players who chose it (out of 404 total).
  + The majority of them are females.
  + All of them are older than 30.
* As for the players who chose to **take a bigger amount** we can see that most of them are 25-40 years old.


<h5>**We are going to perform a few chi-square tests in order to understand better which variables are independent in our data:**</h5> 

**1)**

* H0: risk taking and the player number (first/second..) are independently distributed
* H1: risk taking and the player number (first/second..) are dependent variables 

```{r}
by_player <- chaser%>%
  select(player_num, risk_taker) %>%
  dplyr::count(risk_taker,player_num)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "player_num", values_from = "n") %>%
  select(2:5)

chisq.test(by_player)
```
* The p-value is 0.5773 so we can not reject H0 and therefore the variables are **not dependent** with a confidence-level of 95%.

**2)**


* H0: risk taking and the player gender are independently distributed
* H1: risk taking and the player gender are dependent variables

```{r}
sum_risk_takers <- colSums(chaser[,c("risk_taker")])

by_gender <- chaser%>%
  select(Gender, risk_taker) %>%
  dplyr::count(risk_taker, Gender) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="Gender", values_from = "n") %>%
  select(2:3)

chisq.test(by_gender)
```

* The p-value is 0.7388 so we can't reject H0 and therefore the variables are **not dependent** with a confidence-level of 95%.


**3)**

* H0: risk taking and the player's age group are independently distributed
* H1: risk taking and the player's age group are dependent variables
* (We will also split it into males age groups and females):

```{r}
#maximum likelihood for proportions is the amount of successes divided by n
proportion_risk_takers <- colMeans(chaser[,c("risk_taker")]) 

ages <- c(14, 26, 30, 35, 45 ,70)
by_age <- chaser %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(Age, ages)) %>%
  dplyr::count(age_group, risk_taker) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="age_group", values_from = "n")


by_age_female <-chaser %>%
  filter(Gender == "female") %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(Age, ages)) %>%
  dplyr::count(age_group, risk_taker) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from="age_group",values_from = "n") 

by_age_male <-chaser %>%
  filter(Gender == "male") %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(Age, ages)) %>%
  dplyr::count(age_group, risk_taker) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="age_group",values_from = "n") 

by_age_test <- by_age %>%
  select(2:6)

by_male_age_test <- by_age_male %>%
  select(2:6)

by_female_age_test <- by_age_female %>%
  select(2:6)
```

```{r}
chisq.test(by_age_test)
chisq.test(by_male_age_test)
chisq.test(by_female_age_test)
```

* We can see that in general risk taking and player's age group are dependent variables.
* And we can also see that in a 95% confidence level:
  + The age affects the rate in which **Male** players will tend to take risks.
  + But it is **not** for the **Female** players.
  


Lets visualize the risk taking proportions by age & gender:

(It's important to note- in our data there is the exact same number of male and female players).

```{r}
graph_by_age <- chaser %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(Age, ages)) %>%
  dplyr::count(age_group, risk_taker) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group,y = n, fill = risk_taker)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position=position_fill()) +
    labs(title="Risk Taking Proportions by Age", x = "Age Group", y = "Risk Taking Proportions")

age_and_gender <- chaser%>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(Age, ages))%>%
  group_by(age_group, Gender)%>%
  dplyr::count(risk_taker)%>%
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(risk_taker == TRUE)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = freq, fill = Gender)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity",                                                                        position=position_dodge()) +
      labs(title="Risk Taking Proportions by Age and Gender", x = "Age Group")

graph_by_age
age_and_gender

```

  + If we look at all the players, we can see that there is an increasing in the risk taking proportions as the age increases.
  + If we look at the players by gender, we can see a clear correlation between the male players and their risk proportions by age, also the proportions are greatly increased from age of 30+.
  + Furthermore, above the age of 30 the players are more likely to take the risk (especially for the male players).

 

**4)**


* H0: risk taking and the fast round amount (divided to groups) are independently distributed 
* H1: risk taking and the fast round amount groups are dependent distributed 
* (The fast round groups are the amount gained in the fast round divided to different ranges)

```{r}
fast_round_groups <- c(0, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,60)

by_fast_round <- chaser %>%
  mutate(fr_k = Fast_round_sum/1000,
         fr_k_groups = cut(fr_k, fast_round_groups)) %>% 
  select(fr_k_groups, risk_taker) %>%
  dplyr::count(fr_k_groups, risk_taker) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="fr_k_groups", values_from="n")

by_fast_round_test <- by_fast_round %>%
  select(2:8)

chisq.test(by_fast_round_test)
```

* The p-value is 0.7246 so we can't reject H0 and therefore the variables are **not dependent** with a confidence-level of 95%.
* This is quite **surprising**, we thought that as players get more money on the fast round, they will be more reluctant to take risks, and therefore the proportions would decrease. That why we expected to see a clear negative connection, but the test showed that with a confidence-level of 95% they are not dependent.




<h4>**Now we are going to focus on the winning proportions:**</h4> 



* We'll create a new table that represent the whole group:
```{r}
# Creating groups for the cut function:
sd_groups = c(0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 25)
avg_age_groups = c(14, 30, 35, 40, 45, 56)

#Creates a new table which is row is a group:
chaser_by_group <- chaser %>%
  group_by(group_id) %>%
  mutate(Avg_age = mean(Age),
         Avg_age_group = cut(Avg_age, avg_age_groups),
         Sd_age = sd(Age),
         Sd_age_group = cut(Sd_age,sd_groups),
         risk_taker_amount = sum(risk_taker), 
         Has_Won = game_result == 1, #True/False
         team_fast_rounds = sum(Fast_round_sum),
         risk_bonus_sum = sum(risk_bonus), #How much the total risks of the group is worth?
         gained = game_result * team_total_sum) %>% #How much money the group got? (0 if lost)
  select(group_id, Avg_age_group, Sd_age,Sd_age_group, Has_Won, Avg_age, risk_taker_amount
         ,team_total_sum, Team_question_answered, team_fast_rounds, risk_bonus_sum, gained) %>%
  distinct() #Delets duplicates

glimpse(chaser_by_group)
```


* Lets check how the group's average age affects the chances of winning
```{r}
Avg_Age_group_graph <- chaser_by_group %>% 
  dplyr::count(Has_Won, Avg_age_group)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Avg_age_group, y = n, fill = Has_Won)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_fill()) +
  labs(title="Winning Proportions by Group Average Age",x = "Average Group Age Range", y = "Proportion")

Avg_Age_group_graph
```


* We can see that groups that their average age was less than 30, had the highest winning rate among the other age groups, and as long as the average age increases, the winning rate decreases!

* Our instincts tell us that since older people have a longer life experience, they will have more chances to answer the questions right. Apparently, in that game it is not necessarily true.



* And what about the age diversity of the group?

```{r}
Std_age_group_graph <- chaser_by_group %>% 
  group_by(Sd_age_group) %>%
  dplyr::count(Has_Won) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sd_age_group, y = n, fill = Has_Won)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_fill()) +
  labs(title="Winning Proportions by Group's Sd",x = "Group's SD Range", y = "Proportion")
  
Std_age_group_graph
  
```


* Since we realized that the younger age groups had higher winning rate, we thought that maybe a more diversed age group will increase the winning rate since the players might have a broader range of knowledge. 
* But it seems like it is best to have a lower sd of age in the group, meaning - groups with more players within the same age range- have higher winning rate (with the exception of 0-2.5).


### Regression Model
<h3>Linear Regression Model:</h3>


* Lets take a look at the correlation between our variables:
```{r}

chaser_lm_corr <- chaser_by_group %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Avg_age, Sd_age, team_total_sum, Team_question_answered, team_fast_rounds, risk_bonus_sum, -group_id) %>%
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot(chaser_lm_corr,type="upper", lab = T, outline.col = "white",
   ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_gray,
   colors = c("steelblue", "white", "darkred"))
```

* Seems like there is a **negative correlation** between the avg & sd age to the team's question answered.


* So we'll try to predict the number of questions that were answered in the last round by the age parameters (avg & sd) of the group.

```{r}
group_questions_lm <- lm(chaser_by_group, formula = Team_question_answered ~ Avg_age+Sd_age) 

summary(group_questions_lm)
```


* We can see a **negative connection** between the average age and the age deviation to the number of questions answered in the final round.
* Although the R-squared is relatively low, the model is **statistically significant** since the p-value is very low.
* With a confidence level of 95% we can say that the average age negatively affects the questions amount, and with a 90% confidence level also the age deviation negatively affects.

* This is **surprising** because we expected to get a positive connection since we thought that older players are likely to have more broader knowledge than younger ones.



* We'll check for over fitting in our model by the VIF values:


```{r}
vif(group_questions_lm)
```

* All the VIFs values are lower than 5, that means there is **no over fitting**.


* Lets check the distribution of our model's residuals:

```{r}

res <- group_questions_lm$residuals
fit <- group_questions_lm$fitted.values

res_table = tibble(res, fit)
ggplot(res_table, aes(x = res)) + geom_density(color="darkolivegreen3") + xlab("residuals") + ggtitle("Residuals Distribution")

ggplot(res_table, aes(sample=res)) + geom_qq() + geom_qq_line()


```

* It seems like the distribution is close to normal but yet, it is not optimal.



* We'll check for homoscedasticity in our model:

```{r}
scatter.smooth(x=fit, y=res, main="Homoscedasticity Plot", xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Residuals")


```

* When it  comes to homoscedasticity,  the residuals are slightly affected from the fitted values, it is not optimal but we will continue with the model.




* Lets see the model by each variable in a plot:

```{r}

sd_plot <- ggplot(chaser_by_group, aes(x = Sd_age,
                       y = Team_question_answered)) +
  geom_jitter() + stat_smooth(method = "lm") + ggtitle("Team's right answers by Sd of age") +
  xlab("sd age") + ylab("Team's right answers")

<h5>**What can we understand from that model?**</h5>

* In generally, younger and homogenize groups are more likely to perform better in the last round (meaning- more likely to win) than other groups.
* This might be a result of the initial selection of players that don't necessarily represent knowledge wise among their age demographic.
* Another reason might be that the new younger generation are significantly more exposed, already at an early age, to huge amount of information than any other generation, thanks to the technology and social media. That might explain why younger player succeeded more than the others.
  



### Conclusions

<h3>Our Conclusions:</h3>


* We found some interesting things about the chaser game show:

  * The average age of the group and it’s deviation has a negative effect on the winning rate (negatively affects the questions answered in the last round, and thus affects the winning rate). The younger the average age is and the more homogeneous it is, the higher are their chances to win.
  
  * We expected groups with a higher average age and more diversed to have better chances to win, since age is associated with knowledge and diversity covers more fields of interest. But this turned out to be wrong. It might be the result of younger people having more access to a broader range of information on the internet.
 
  *	Older players tend to take more risks than younger players, the increase in the rate is especially more drastic for the male players. This might be due to older people usually being more stable financially than younger people, and thus willing to take the risk.

  * We found that in the whole 4 seasons of the show, there were exactly 202 male players and 202 female players, which might be a sign of caution by the producers.


* Note:	While working on the project we achieved experience in code writing, data visualizing and statistics tests & principles implementations.
